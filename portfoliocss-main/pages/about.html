         The tourist guide is a person who provides commentary and discovery of heritage (regions, cities, monuments, historical sites, museums, etc.) [1]. It takes care of a group of people as part of a themed visit, in a defined place (in Belgium or abroad) and provides various information on historical, artistic, cultural, architectural, gastronomic aspects, etc.

        He must effectively manage the itinerary, the time spent in the activity and ensure that his comments are dynamic. Before going into the field, he therefore carries out an important preparatory work by carrying out in-depth research on the subject as well as a location, in order to estimate the necessary duration and to "fix" his comments on the progress of the visit. . The time of the visit can sometimes be very short, he must also be able to distinguish "the essential" from "the accessory". If he does not already work under the status of employee on a site or for a museum, he makes sure to contact the various institutions or sites, and to obtain the required authorizations. They must also know the practical aspects of the visit (parking lots, meal breaks, restaurant reservations, indication of souvenir shops, etc.). The tourist guide may be required to make his visits on foot, by coach, by boat, etc.</textarea>
